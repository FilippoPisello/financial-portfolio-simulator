OUTPUT CREATION
- Aggregated returns consists of a dataframe per strategy:
    - Invested amount min, -2sd, median, +2sd, max
    - Countervalue min, -2sd, median, +2sd, max
    - ROI min, -2sd, median, +2sd, max
- Len of each returns is aligned by repeating the last value as many times as
needed

SIMULATION
- Lump sum investment invests everything at t0
    - Investment = total investment at t0
    - Investment is constant in every other period
    - Countervalue per period is equal to amount investment times change in share
    price
    - ROI is equal to countervalue divided by investment
    - Closing ROI is the last ROI

DATASET CREATION
- Starting date is not always the same
- Data download function is always called with a date between min and max
starting date
- Dataset returns a list with as items as number of simulations
- Data download function is called as many times as number of simulations
- Starting and ending date of data download function are always
4 * number_of_financial_periods weeks apart
- Too much date conversion around
- Randomization of parameters and dataset creation should be split
