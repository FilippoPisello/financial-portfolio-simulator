[TO DO]
Setting up simulation:
- Inputs:
  - Have to specify a symbol
  - Have to specify a duration in months
    - If start date + duration more than latest record trim simulation with
    warning
  - Can specify a minimum start date
    - If start date before earliest record error
  - Can specify a maximum start date
    - If start date after latest record error
  - Can specify number of iterations
    - If number of iterations less than error
  - Have to define a test investment strategy that for each day in the simulation
  can buy/sell
    - Biased cost averaging
  - Can define one or more benchmark investment strategies
Running the simulation:
- Wallet value is updated
Assessing performance:
- Plot distribution of final ROI: one chart with multiple histograms.
- Plot ROI over time: average + 2sd + 3sd + min + max





[DONE]
- Investing lump sum means investing the entire amount in the first day
- Simple cost averaging means investing a fixed amount at the first working
day of each month
